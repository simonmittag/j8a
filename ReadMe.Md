## Up and running

### Docker
```
docker pull simonmittag/j8a &&
  docker run -e J8ACFG_YML -p443:443 simonmittag/j8a
```

### Homebrew
```bash
brew tap simonmittag/cli && 
  brew install j8a && 
  j8a
```

### Golang
```bash
go install github.com/simonmittag/j8a/cmd/j8a &&
  j8a
```

## Usage
J8a runs from the cli. The process will attempt to load its configuration from the environment 
variable `J8ACFG_YML`, a specified config file, or the default config file `j8acfg.yml` (in that order). 
You can validate the config using the `-o` flag without actually starting the server, which 
is useful for ci/cd pipelines. In validate mode, the process successfully exits with `0`, or `-1` in case of failure.

### Commandline Options

```bash
Œª j8a -h
j8a[v1.0.1] Goodde da lodia!
Usage: j8a [-c] [-o] | [-v] | [-h]
  -c string
        config file location (default "j8acfg.yml").
  -h    print usage instructions.
  -o    validate config file, then exit.
  -v    print version.
```

### Examples

Validate Server Configuration supplied as `myconfig.yml`
```bash
Œª j8a -c myconfig.yml -o
6:25PM INF hostName determined hostName=MacBook-Pro-16.local
6:25PM INF version determined version=v1.0.1
6:25PM INF srvID determined srvID=c91cda8c
...
```

Start Server With Configuration supplied as `myconfig.yml`
```bash
Œª j8a -c myconfig.yml 
6:25PM INF hostName determined hostName=MacBook-Pro-16.local
6:25PM INF version determined version=v1.0.1
6:25PM INF srvID determined srvID=c91cda8c
...
```

Start Server With Configuration supplied via `J8ACFG_YML`
```bash
J8ACFG_YML="---
            connection:
              downstream:
                http:
                  port: 80
            routes:
              - path: "/todos"
                resource: jsonplaceholder
            resources:
              jsonplaceholder:
                - url:
                    scheme: https
                    host: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
                    port: 443" j8a

## Release Cycle
* Now that 1.0 is reached, we usually release 3/4 minor versions per year.
* Bug-fixes (e.g. 1.0.1, 1.0.2) are released as needed (no additional features are delivered in those versions, bug-fixes only).
* Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out).
